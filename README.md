# Entropy: Chaos Mod
Entropy is a Chaos Mod where random events happen every 30 seconds. The events are selected randomly from a pool of near 150 (and growing) events that can be anything from meteor rain, physics changes and much more.

Event and timer duration can be configured from the Settings menu!

Entropy was heavily inspired on the excellent work of pongo1231's [Chaos Mod V](https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod/ChaosModV) for Grand Theft Auto V!

## Multiplayer:
Play Entropy with friends! Each random event happens around each player. Each connected client can configure Twitch Integrations independently and will send poll results to the server.
To change Entropy Settings on multiplayer, please change the parameters inside the config/entropy.json file in the server folder.

## Twitch Integration:
Entropy includes integration with Twitch! Viewers of a streamer can vote the next event using the stream chat! (Integration for more platforms like Youtube streaming and Discord is planned).

To enable Twitch Integration you'll need a Twitch OAuth Access token, you can generate using [this tool](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/) (or any other OAuth token generator tool).
Write your OAuth Access Token and your channel name in Entropy Settings.
## YouTube Integration:
In a similar fashion to the twitch integration, Entropy also includes the ability for YouTube streamers to connect with their YouTube Live Chat for event voting.

It requires the creation of a Google Cloud Platform project and some configuration. [Click here](https://youtu.be/i2cn_IXLoFE) for a video tutorial, there's also a written guide in that video's description

NOTICE: YouTube implements a daily limit of requests limiting the amount of time the mod can be played with YouTube integration. In order to increase the playable time, YouTube integration votes will be counted less often, making the vote bars look laggy. Usually the quota is reached after around 3 hours.

## Discord Integration:
Users of a discord server can vote the next event by using the Entropy Discord integration. TUTORIAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waj82ownAKw
